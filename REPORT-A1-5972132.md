Student: <5972132> - <Razvan> <Agapi>

## Task Distribution

### Planned

Razvan - Task 2 and 3
Samuel - Tasks 4, 5 and 6
Stefan - Task 1, UML Diagram, Report and Testing

- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect all students to have the same workload."
- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect <Razvan> (<5972132>) to handle about 30% of the workload,
  <Stefan> (<5625343>) to handle about 30% of the workload, and <Samuel> (<5866413>) to handle about 30% of the workload."

### Executed

In this section you report the tasks you performed in practice, AND what tasks you believe your team members performed. Again, be as detailed as possible. This is YOUR report, i.e., your take on the work distribution of all students in this group. For each student, report two things: (a) the tasks and (b) the overall workload. This reporting will be used as the basis for any disputes.

- Student <5972132 >: (Razvan Agapi)
    - Tasks:
        - Tasks 1 and 2
    - Workload:
        - I believe I did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5625343>:
    - Tasks:
        - Task 2, UML Diagram, Report and Testing
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Stefan> did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5866413>:
    - Tasks:
        - Tasks 4, 5 and 6
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Samuel> did 1/3 of the work.

> NOTE: The workload distribution will impact individual grades (if other than equal workloads). If we note any discrepancies in the reports, the work distribution will be discussed with the group.

## Use of GenAI

- **Data Loading**: AI supported my understanding of the Apache Commons CSV library and its use within the `DataLoader` class. I explored how to iterate
  over CSV records efficiently using prompts like "What is the Apache Commons CSV dependency?" and "How to use iterators for parsing a CSV file?".
  This enabled me to correctly implement the logic for loading and parsing trace data.
