## Task Distribution

### Planned

Samuel - Tasks 1 and 2
Stefan - Task 3 and Diagram
Razvan - Task 4 and Testing Suites

- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect all students to have the same workload."
- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect <Samuel> (<5866413>) to handle about 30% of the workload,
  <Stefan> (<5625343>) to handle about 30% of the workload, and <Razvan> (<5972132>) to handle about 30% of the workload."

### Executed

In this section you report the tasks you performed in practice, AND what tasks you believe your team members performed. Again, be as detailed as possible. This is YOUR report, i.e., your take on the work distribution of all students in this group. For each student, report two things: (a) the tasks and (b) the overall workload. This reporting will be used as the basis for any disputes.

- Student <5866413>:
    - Tasks:
        - Task 2
        - Task 4
    - Workload:
        - I believe he did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5625343>: (Toana Stefan)
    - Tasks:
        - Task 3
        - UML Diagram
    - Workload:
        - I believe that I did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5972132>:
    - Tasks:
        - Task 1
        - Tests
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Razvan> did 1/3 of the work.

> NOTE: The workload distribution will impact individual grades (if other than equal workloads). If we note any discrepancies in the reports, the work distribution will be discussed with the group.

## Use of GenAI
***
During the course of our project, I have used Generative AI (model: ChatGPT 5) to assist with these tasks:

- **YML CI/CD**: Understanding YML files and CI/CD pipelines along with their implementation into Gitlab, it helped me understand the process of CI/CD and how to implement it,
  I asked the GPT to help me understand yml syntax which I found in the OOP project pipeline with prompts like "what does the cache for yml files do?" and
  "should i use maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-17". I also used it to have a deeper understanding of yaml syntax (which i found here https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/).
  I also used it to find out how to do custom checkstyles, with things like suppresions.xml which allowed us to have a finished and complete project faster.
- **UML Diagram**: I used Generative AI to help figure out how to connect the new classes and interfaces along with representing files(like the ones that ReportGenerator reports into)
  and to double-check if my UML syntax and implementation was correct.

#### Usfullness
***
I consider that the use of Generative AI extremely useful in this project, it not only allowed me to complete my tasks faster, but also better
with things like checkstyle customizations and various error handling hacks allowing for a deeper understanding of new concepts.
