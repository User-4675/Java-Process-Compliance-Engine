# Advanced Programming, 2025-2026 | Assignment 2

Student: <5866413> - <Samuel> <Mikuláš>

## Task Distribution

### Planned

Samuel - Tasks 2 and 4
Stefan - Task 3 and Diagram
Razvan - Task 1 and Testing Suites

- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect all students to have the same workload."
- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect <Samuel> (<5866413>) to handle about 30% of the workload, 
     <Stefan> (<5625343>) to handle about 30% of the workload, and <Razvan> (<5972132>) to handle about 30% of the workload."

### Executed

In this section you report the tasks you performed in practice, AND what tasks you believe your team members performed. Again, be as detailed as possible. This is YOUR report, i.e., your take on the work distribution of all students in this group. For each student, report two things: (a) the tasks and (b) the overall workload. This reporting will be used as the basis for any disputes.

- Student <5866413>: (Samuel Mikuláš)
    - Tasks:
        - Task 4
        - Task 2
    - Workload:
        - I believe I did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5625343>:
    - Tasks:
        - Task 3
        - UML Diagram
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Stefan> did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5972132>:
    - Tasks:
        - Task 1
        - Testing 
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Razvan> did 1/3 of the work.

> NOTE: The workload distribution will impact individual grades (if other than equal workloads). If we note any discrepancies in the reports, the work distribution will be discussed with the group.

## Use of GenAI
***
During the course of our project, I have used Generative AI (model: ChatGPT 5) to assist with these tasks:

  - **Clarification and Implementation of Compliance Check Rules**: AI assisted me with implementation of `ThreeWayBeforGR.class` rule, as I found this to be the most complex one. 
        Model was prompted with - "Explain ThreeWayBeforeGR check rules", "Give examples of compliant and non-compliant trace" and "Test this code: `<code-snippet>` 
        against generated testcases". Code in `ThreeWayBeforeGR`, mainly its methods `condition1/2/3` are partially generated by AI (ChatGPT 5). However, code was also rewritten
        and tested by me and by the test classes for correctness.

   - **CI Pipeline**: Implementation of pipeline was heavily guided by AI, as this was my first encounter with .yml files. I used AI for clarification of assignment,
    and to get familiar with syntax of yaml file. I used prompts such as "What is yaml file ?", "How does yaml file interact with GitLab ? ", "What are job artefacts ?"
    and similar. The `conformance_check` stage of the pipeline was initially generated by AI, however, it was rewritten and tested by me.
   

#### Usfullness
***
I consider generative AI highly useful for this project, as it provided personalized explanations of the tasks and guided me through their implementation. Additionally, 
it assisted in generating example test cases that helped verify the correctness of my code.
