# Advanced Programming, 2025-2026 | Assignment 2

Student: <5972132> - <Razvan> <Agapi>

## Task Distribution

### Planned

Samuel - Tasks 1 and 2
Stefan - Task 3 and Diagram
Razvan - Task 4 and Testing Suites

- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect all students to have the same workload."
- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect <Samuel> (<5866413>) to handle about 30% of the workload,
  <Stefan> (<5625343>) to handle about 30% of the workload, and <Razvan> (<5972132>) to handle about 30% of the workload."

### Executed

In this section you report the tasks you performed in practice, AND what tasks you believe your team members performed. Again, be as detailed as possible. This is YOUR report, i.e., your take on the work distribution of all students in this group. For each student, report two things: (a) the tasks and (b) the overall workload. This reporting will be used as the basis for any disputes.

- Student <5866413>:
    - Tasks:
        - Task 1
        - Task 2
    - Workload:
        - I believe <Samuel> did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5625343>:
    - Tasks:
        - Task 3
        - UML Diagram
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Stefan> did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5972132>: (Agapi Razvan)
    - Tasks:
        - Task 4
        - Tests for all of the strategies
    - Workload:
        - I believe that I did 1/3 of the work.

> NOTE: The workload distribution will impact individual grades (if other than equal workloads). If we note any discrepancies in the reports, the work distribution will be discussed with the group.

## Use of GenAI
***
During the course of our project, I have used Generative AI (model: ChatGPT 5) to assist with these tasks:

- **Unit testing and Internal testing**: Artificial Intelligence helped me test the ThreeWayBeforeGR strategy more in detail because it was the most complex 
- strategy and I wanted to make sure that there was no edge case left out I did not see so I prompted the AI to "Analyse these test cases I gave you and think 
- of any edge cases possible and explain them back to me". I did not generate
- code.

#### Usfullness
***
I consider generative AI highly useful for this project, because it helped me tackle down every possibility of missing out some edge cases. It also helped me understand 
everything more clearly.
