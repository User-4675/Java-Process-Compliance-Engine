# Advanced Programming, 2025-2026 | Assignment 1

Student: <5866413> - <Samuel> <Mikuláš>

## Task Distribution

### Planned

Samuel - Tasks 4, 5 and 6
Stefan - Task 1, UML Diagram, Report and Testing
Razvan - Task 2 and 3

- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect all students to have the same workload."
- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect <Samuel> (<5866413>) to handle about 30% of the workload, 
     <Stefan> (<5625343>) to handle about 30% of the workload, and <Razvan> (<5972132>) to handle about 30% of the workload."

### Executed

In this section you report the tasks you performed in practice, AND what tasks you believe your team members performed. Again, be as detailed as possible. This is YOUR report, i.e., your take on the work distribution of all students in this group. For each student, report two things: (a) the tasks and (b) the overall workload. This reporting will be used as the basis for any disputes.

- Student <5866413>: (Samuel Mikuláš)
    - Tasks:
        - Task 4 
        - Task 5 
        - Task 6
    - Workload:
        - I believe I did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5625343>:
    - Tasks:
        - Task 1
        - UML Diagram
        - Report
        - Testing 
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Stefan> did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5972132>:
    - Tasks:
        - Task 2
        - Task 3
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Razvan> did 1/3 of the work.

> NOTE: The workload distribution will impact individual grades (if other than equal workloads). If we note any discrepancies in the reports, the work distribution will be discussed with the group.

## Use of GenAI
During the course of our project, we used Generative AI (model: ChatGPT 5) to assist with several tasks:

- **Design Patterns**: Although I am already familiar with the Observer pattern, implementing the Producer-Consumer pattern posed challenges. AI assisted 
        me in understanding the pattern by explaining the roles of producers and consumers. It also helped clarify thread logic and anonymous function 
        usage in thread initialization, through prompts such as "Explain the Producer-Consumer pattern" and "How should an anonymous function in thread 
        initialization look?"

- **Multithreading**: The use of `BlockingQueue` and `LinkedBlockingQueue` was new to me. AI provided explanations on how blocking queues operate, why 
        threads may block, and the handling of `InterruptedException`. Prompts included "How does BlockingQueue work?" and "When and why does a blocking 
        queue block threads?"

- **Application UI and Animations**: AI guided me in enhancing the user interface with colored console text, suggesting the use of a `ConsoleColor` enum 
        instead of string-based color codes. For live progress simulation, AI provided strategies for implementing smooth animations, including separating 
        data loading from progress display, using a dedicated thread, and optimal sleep intervals. Prompts included "How can we separate animation from data 
        loading?" and "How does `.flush()` work to improve live progress display?"

Regarding the **usefulness** of AI, we state that it significantly assisted us in understanding the assignment and its key concepts. 
It accelerated the development process and provided more focused guidance for our project. However, there were instances where AI 
produced incorrect or misleading suggestions, which required verification and, in some cases, led to longer debugging sessions. 
Overall, our experience was positive, as AI effectively sped up repetitive tasks such as generating test cases and improving the user 
interface, allowing us to concentrate more on implementing the core logic of the project.
