# Advanced Programming, 2025-2026 | Assignment 1

Student: <5625343> - <Stefan> <Toana>

## Task Distribution

### Planned

Razvan - Task 2 and 3
Samuel - Tasks 4, 5 and 6
Stefan - Task 1, UML Diagram, Report and Testing

This part should include an explicit declaration of expected workload, stating that all students are expected to have the same workload or, if not, the expected load distribution. See an example of each below:
- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect all students to have the same workload."
- "Based on the task distribution above, I declare that I expect <Razvan> (<5972132>) to handle about 30% of the workload,
  <Stefan> (<5625343>) to handle about 30% of the workload, and <Samuel> (<5866413>) to handle about 30% of the workload."
### Executed

In this section you report the tasks you performed in practice, AND what tasks you believe your team members performed. Again, be as detailed as possible. This is YOUR report, i.e., your take on the work distribution of all students in this group. For each student, report two things: (a) the tasks and (b) the overall workload. This reporting will be used as the basis for any disputes.


- Student <5625343>: (Stefan Toana)
    - Tasks:
        - Task 1, UML Diagram, Report and Testing
    - Workload:
        - I believe I did 1/3 of the work.

- Student <5866413>: 
    - Tasks:
        - Tasks 4, 5 and 6
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Stefan> did 1/3 of the work.


- Student <5972132>:
    - Tasks:
        - Tasks 2 and 3
    - Workload:
        - I believe that <Razvan> did 1/3 of the work.

> NOTE: The workload distribution will impact individual grades (if other than equal workloads). If we note any discrepancies in the reports, the work distribution will be discussed with the group.
## Use of GenAI
During the course of our project, we used Generative AI (model: ChatGPT 5) to assist with several tasks:
- **Testing**: AI contributed to designing test cases and generating sample CSV files for testing purposes. Prompts such as "What classes should be tested?","Generate a testing CSV file", and "What other tests should we use to verify our project?" helped me ensure comprehensive coverage. All tests were
reviewed and validated to confirm correctness.

- **UML Diagram**: AI helped me learn what a UML diagram is and how to make a UML diagram(Prompts: "if the csv database is a .csv is it fine to leave it as a package for a uml?", "is this fine?"- asking about how to represent the DataLoader, "TraceStatus is an enum, how should i represent it"). The prompts helped me
streamline the UML making process and help me better understand what a UML diagram is and how it should work.

- **Clarification of Assignment Requirements**: AI helped me interpret the assignment specifications, particularly regarding compliance rules.
For example, i prompted it to clarify conditions such as "Should 'Record Invoice Receipt' never precede 'Cancel Invoice Receipt'?" and provided
guidance on understanding the structure of the CSV file.

-**Usefullness**: I feel like AI was extremely useful, it not only made the process and research way easier, but it also acted like a safeguard at the end, helping check and solve mistakes before the changes were live,
for example the "is this fine prompt" confirmed that the diagram i made by myself was correct and that I should continue in the same way onwards. It also helped with mondane tasks such as generating test cases which made
the whole development process way faster.
